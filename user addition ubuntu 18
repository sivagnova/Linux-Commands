This might be because useradd didn't create a home directory for your new user. You should use

adduser xyz
instead and avoid using useradd since it is a backend command needing more input.

See also this answer, man useradd and man adduser.

Or if you still want to use useradd use at least

useradd -m xyz
to create a home directory. But this still might be insufficient.

Before starting now you might want to remove the user you created wrong by

userdel xyz


Do not use useradd for desktop. you can only do that for server

sudo adduser gokul admin 
sudo adduser gokul sudo

/* use sudo or admin depending on the need*/
